                                    <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                                       Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                                        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
                                     <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
                                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                                        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

                                <h2>Duck, Duck, Tree! Release 1.0</h2>
                                <p>After a week of many hours of development, I am now releasing the my first HTML5 game on jupiterFrog! Now, there is a 60 second timer and intense music to make the game feel more competitive in a way. Of course, once we start to have webinars with these games will the real fun begin. 

	

                                    The goal of this game is to represent that approximately 15 billion trees are cut for every five billion that are planted. This is not a good rate! It teaches that while we must consistently tend to our planet, we also must take the measures to prevent devastating events, such as deforestation, from happening in the first place. Otherwise, it will be a race with the clock (just like the game). However, I don't mean that we have to suddenly go out there and ban all lumberjacks. Taking preventative measures to control the amount of paper and products made from trees in our daily lives will make a positive impact!
                                
                                
                                    I have to admit that the game is not perfect, however, I believe it is sufficient for now because of my level of experience. Also! Not to forget that I couldn't have done it without the help of the very skilled Halil Cakar and my good friend Obinna who listened when I struggled. :D The next game I will be coding will be a avoid the spikes type game about recycling. As always, I will update you here. Thanks!
